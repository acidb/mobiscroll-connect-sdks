# Changelog

All notable changes to the Mobiscroll Connect PHP SDK (Packagist: `mobiscroll/connect-php`) are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this SDK's major.minor always matches the Connect API's (for example API 1.5.x → SDK 1.5.x): each release bumps only the patch, including releases with breaking changes. Patch numbers are independent per SDK, so this file covers the PHP SDK only.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-10-08

### Added

- `webhooks()->verifyWebhook()` checks a delivery's Ed25519 signature and timestamp and returns the parsed `WebhookDelivery`, or throws `WebhookVerificationError`. It fetches and caches the public keys from `/.well-known/webhook-keys` and re-fetches them once before rejecting, so key rotations need no action.
- `webhookKeyCache` client option: a PSR-16 cache that shares the fetched keys across PHP-FPM requests and workers.
- `webhookPublicKey` client option: a pinned key, used only when the keys endpoint cannot be reached.
- `WebhookVerifier::verifyWebhookSignature()` for verifying against keys you supply, with no fetching.
- Requires the `sodium` extension (bundled with PHP) and `psr/simple-cache`.

## [1.5.1] — 2026-09-22
